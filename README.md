GhostMode is a minimalist web app designed to help users unplug and recharge by tracking digital detox sessions and encouraging daily streaks. It features start and end detox session buttons to track minutes detoxed, a daily streak counter for motivation, a notes area to journal activities done instead of social media, motivational quotes to inspire calm, badges awarded for streak milestones, and a mini puzzle game for light, mindful screen time. Built with Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it requires Python 3.x and Django installed (pip install django). To run locally, clone the repo (git clone https://github.com/JhanaviR082/gmp.git), navigate into the folder (cd gmp), optionally create and activate a virtual environment (python -m venv venv and source venv/bin/activate on macOS/Linux or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows), install dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt or just pip install django), run migrations (python manage.py migrate), then start the server (python manage.py runserver). Finally, open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser to see the app in action.
