The choice of a good data structure makes it possible to perform a variety of critical operations effectively. An efficient data structure also uses minimum memory space and execution time to process the structure. A data structure is not only used for organising the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge of data structures.

Need Of Data Structure:
The structure of the data and the synthesis of the algorithm are relative to each other. Data presentation must be easy to understand so the developer, as well as the user, can make an efficient implementation of the operation.
Data structures provide an easy way of organising, retrieving, managing, and storing data.

Here is a list of the needs for data.

Data structure modification is easy. 
It requires less time. 
Save storage memory space. 
Data representation is easy. 
Easy access to the large database
Classification/Types of Data Structures:
    Linear Data Structure
    Non-Linear Data Structure.
  Linear Data Structure:
Elements are arranged in one dimension ,also known as linear dimension.
Example: lists, stack, queue, etc.
 Non-Linear Data Structure
Elements are arranged in one-many, many-one and many-many dimensions.
Example: tree, graph, table, etc.
Classification of Data Structure

Please refer DSA Tutorial for complete tutorial on Data Strictures with guide on every topic, practice problems and top interview questions.

Most Popular Data Structures: 
1. Array:
An array is a collection of data items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array). 


Array Data Structure
2. Linked Lists:
Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers. 


Linked Data Structure


3. Stack:
Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). In stack, all insertion and deletion are permitted at only one end of the list.

Stack Operations:

push(): When this operation is performed, an element is inserted into the stack.
pop(): When this operation is performed, an element is removed from the top of the stack and is returned.
top(): This operation will return the last inserted element that is at the top without removing it.
size(): This operation will return the size of the stack i.e. the total number of elements present in the stack.
isEmpty(): This operation indicates whether the stack is empty or not.
4. Queue:
Like Stack, Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). In the queue, items are inserted at one end and deleted from the other end. A good example of the queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added. 


Queue Data Structure
Queue Operations:

Enqueue(): Adds (or stores) an element to the end of the queue..
Dequeue(): Removal of elements from the queue.
Peek() or front(): Acquires the data element available at the front node of the queue without deleting it.
rear(): This operation returns the element at the rear end without removing it.
isFull(): Validates if the queue is full.
isNull(): Checks if the queue is empty.
5. Binary Tree:
Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack and queues, which are linear data structures, trees are hierarchical data structures. A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. It is implemented mainly using Links. 

A Binary Tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node in the tree. If the tree is empty, then the value of root is NULL. A Binary Tree node contains the following parts. 

1. Data
2. Pointer to left child
3. Pointer to the right child

Binary Tree Data Structure
6. Binary Search Tree:
A Binary Search Tree is a Binary Tree following the additional properties: 

The left part of the root node contains keys less than the root node key.
The right part of the root node contains keys greater than the root node key.
There is no duplicate key present in the binary tree.
A Binary tree having the following properties is known as Binary search tree (BST).


Binary Search Tree Data Structure
7. Heap:
A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types: 

Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of its children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of its children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

Max and Min Heap
8. Hash Table Data Structure:
Hashing is an important Data Structure which is designed to use a special function called the Hash function which is used to map a given value with a particular key for faster access of elements. The efficiency of mapping depends on the efficiency of the hash function used. 

Let a hash function H(x) maps the value x at the index x%10 in an Array. For example, if the list of values is [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] it will be stored at positions {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} in the array or Hash table respectively. 


Hash Data Structure
9. Matrix:
A matrix represents a collection of numbers arranged in an order of rows and columns. It is necessary to enclose the elements of a matrix in parentheses or brackets. 

A matrix with 9 elements is shown below. 


Matrix
10. Trie:
Trie is an efficient information retrieval data structure. Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to an optimal limit (key length). If weFor the Digital Detox Week campaign, see Adbusters § Digital Detox Week.

A digital detox is a time without digital devices, such as smartphones.
A digital detox is a deliberate break from digital devices to mitigate screen overuse and promote offline activities.[1][2] Emerging in response to increasing technology use, the practice addresses concerns about screen addiction’s impact on health and mental well-being. Detox approaches range from setting limits on device usage to complete abstinence, sometimes supported by dedicated retreats or travel packages. Though digital detoxes have shown positive effects on focus, relationships, and overall well-being, they may also raise social pressures and fear of missing out (FOMO).[3]

Background[edit]

Definition[edit]
A digital detox is a period of time when a person voluntarily refrains from using digital devices such as smartphones, computers, and social media platforms.[1][2] It encourages awareness of technology use and is aimed at mitigating digital dependency and promoting offline engagement. Subsets of a digital detox include varying levels of decreased electronic use, messaging, social media, and applications.[4]

History[edit]
Since 2015, discussion and research on the implications of a digital detox have increased.[5] The areas of research can be broken into five main categories: communication, education, tourism, well-being and health, and work environments. The increase in technological advancements has led to a growing demand for research on digital detoxes. The use of video conferencing during COVID-19 has increased the stress-related depletion of physiological resources, leading to negative effects on health.[6]

Celebrities and influencers have promoted the concept of a digital detox. Ed Sheeran and Kendall Jenner have undergone a social media detox and influenced others to do one as well.[7] Comedian Ari Shaffir gained attention for refusing to use a smartphone after concerns about spending too much time on it, especially on social media.[8]

Motivations[edit]
A digital detox aims to counteract the negative impacts of excessive screen and technology use, which can lead to both physical and mental health issues.  

Physical effects[edit]
Physical effects of technology addiction include illness caused by germs on a phone, eye strain, wrist strain, and neck problems.[9] Neck problems, sometimes called ‘tech neck’, result from leaning the head forward for extended periods to look at a phone. This can lead to chronic pain and deformities such as hunchback.  Neck and back pain from excessive phone use can also lead to extreme migraines.[10]

The brain, especially grey matter and the cerebral cortex is also impacted by screen time. Adults with a diagnosed smartphone addiction have lower gray matter volume and a thinner cerebral cortex compared to those of adults without smartphone addictions. Gray matter is responsible for movement, memory, and emotions. The cerebral cortex is responsible for memory, decision-making, and problem-solving.[11]

Sleep habits are also impacted by smartphone use, as blue light from screens can disrupt sleep patterns through the suppression of the hormone melatonin. This hormone imbalance from diminished melatonin disrupts the REM sleep cycle which is essential for storing memories in the brain.[12]

Mental health and behavioral changes[edit]
Technology reprograms people to feel more anxious when they are not in its presence. Additionally, having a phone close to a person’s face can trigger a fight or flight response, setting an anxious tone for the day.[13] Screen time’s effect on mental health can also be demonstrated through a positive correlation between depression and screen time. Screen time, specifically in the form of social media, has been found to harm self-esteem.[14]

Screen addiction shares some characteristics with other addictions including alcohol dependence and gambling. Reward-style games, such as some downloadable on smartphones, have been found to lead to obsessive behaviors.[15] Additionally, screen addiction can affect children's ability to learn and focus.[14]

Process[edit]
The process of a digital detox can vary widely depending on an individual’s goals, motivations, and lifestyle.[16] Methods include deleting media platforms, muting notifications, and abstaining entirely from digital media.[17] There are three different variables in a digital detox: time frame, the extent of intervention, and the amount of outside assistance.[18] Generally, digital detoxification can be split into two categories: moderate and complete.

Moderate detox[edit]
A moderate digital detox involves limiting device and social media usage. Common executions in a moderate detox center on setting boundaries. Examples of boundaries include limiting social media usage to specific times of day or implementing screen-free periods, especially in the morning or evening.[19] One way of curbing overuse of digital devices is to allocate some of the uses of a smartphone to non-digital means. In 2019 Google announced a "paper phone" which can contain daily agendas, directions, and other uses so that people rely less on their smartphone.[20] Another key element of a moderate detox is controlling the frequency of notifications and alerts.[21] This can alleviate the temptation to check devices continuously throughout the day.

Complete detox[edit]
A complete detox is an absolute break from digital devices for a set period. This form of detox can be conducted for various periods, the most common ranging between a week and a month. During a complete detox, individuals delete or log out of all social media and messaging apps. Many disable their devices entirely.[22] Some individuals implement this form of detox during a vacation or a period when there are no work or social obligations that would require their online presence. The tourism industry has found a niche market for 'digital detox travel packages' where tourists are disconnected from their Information and communications technology by traveling to remote areas. A study from University of Nottingham Ningbo China found that the biggest motivators for embarking on a digital detox holiday include mindfulness, technostress, relaxation, and self-expression.[23] Digital detox retreats increase accountability among individuals and prevent the temptation to check devices or engage in habitual online activities.

Impact[edit]
Relationships[edit]
Digital detoxes have been found to have a positive impact on relationships from a refocus on offline social interactions. People can build stronger social bonds when they do not check their phones as frequently.[24] Despite this positive impact, studies have found negative effects of digital detoxes on social relationships and interactions. Digital detoxes have also been shown to cause a higher social pressure on participants during social media abstinence compared to pre-intervention social pressure measurements. Furthermore, some research indicates that digital detoxes can result in the fear of missing out (FOMO) on social activities.[25]

Ed Sheeran and Kendall Jenner have undergone a social media detox and influenced others to do one as well.[7] Comedian Ari Shaffir gained attention for refusing to use a smartphone after concerns about spending too much time on it, especially on social media.[8]

Motivations[edit]
A digital detox aims to counteract the negative impacts of excessive screen and technology use, which can lead to both physical and mental health issues.  

Physical effects[edit]
Physical effects of technology addiction include illness caused by germs on a phone, eye strain, wrist strain, and neck problems.[9] Neck problems, sometimes called ‘tech neck’, result from leaning the head forward for extended periods to look at a phone. This can lead to chronic pain and deformities such as hunchback.  Neck and back pain from excessive phone use can also lead to extreme migraines.[10]
For the Digital Detox Week campaign, see Adbusters § Digital Detox Week.

A digital detox is a time without digital devices, such as smartphones.
A digital detox is a deliberate break from digital devices to mitigate screen overuse and promote offline activities.[1][2] Emerging in response to increasing technology use, the practice addresses concerns about screen addiction’s impact on health and mental well-being. Detox approaches range from setting limits on device usage to complete abstinence, sometimes supported by dedicated retreats or travel packages. Though digital detoxes have shown positive effects on focus, relationships, and overall well-being, they may also raise social pressures and fear of missing out (FOMO).[3]

Background[edit]
See also: Digital media use and mental health, Problematic social media use, and Problematic smartphone use
Definition[edit]
A digital detox is a period of time when a person voluntarily refrains from using digital devices such as smartphones, computers, and social media platforms.[1][2] It encourages awareness of technology use and is aimed at mitigating digital dependency and promoting offline engagement. Subsets of a digital detox include varying levels of decreased electronic use, messaging, social media, and applications.[4]

History[edit]
Since 2015, discussion and research on the implications of a digital detox have increased.[5] The areas of research can be broken into five main categories: communication, education, tourism, well-being and health, and work environments. The increase in technological advancements has led to a growing demand for research on digital detoxes. The use of video conferencing during COVID-19 has increased the stress-related depletion of physiological resources, leading to negative effects on health.[6]

This can lead to chronic pain and deformities such as hunchback.  Neck and back pain from excessive phone use can also lead to extreme migraines.[10]

The brain, especially grey matter and the cerebral cortex is also impacted by screen time. Adults with a diagnosed smartphone addiction have lower gray matter volume and a thinner cerebral cortex compared to those of adults without smartphone addictions. Gray matter is responsible for movement, memory, and emotions. The cerebral cortex is responsible for memory, decision-making, and problem-solving.[11]

Sleep habits are also impacted by smartphone use, as blue light from screens can disrupt sleep patterns through the suppression of the hormone melatonin. This hormone imbalance from diminished melatonin disrupts the REM sleep cycle which is essential for storing memories in the brain.[12]

Mental health and behavioral changes[edit]
Technology reprograms people to feel more anxious when they are not in its presence. Additionally, having a phone close to a person’s face can trigger a fight or flight response, setting an anxious tone for the day.[13] Screen time’s effect on mental health can also be demonstrated through a positive correlation between depression and screen time. Screen time, specifically in the form of social media, has been found to harm self-esteem.[14]

Screen addiction shares some characteristics with other addictions including alcohol dependence and gambling. Reward-style games, such as some downloadable on smartphones, have been found to lead to obsessive behaviors.[15] Additionally, screen addiction can affect children's ability to learn and focus.[14]

Process[edit]
The process of a digital detox can vary widely depending on an individual’s goals, motivations, and lifestyle.[16] Methods include deleting media platforms, muting notifications, and abstaining entirely from digital media.[17] There are three different variables in a digital detox: time frame, the extent of intervention, and the amount of outside assistance.[18] Generally, digital detoxification can be split into two categories: moderate and complete.

Moderate detox[edit]
A moderate digital detox involves limiting device and social media usage. Common executions in a moderate detox center on setting boundaries. Examples of boundaries include limiting social media usage to specific times of day or implementing screen-free periods, especially in the morning or evening.[19] One way of curbing overuse of digital devices is to allocate some of the uses of a smartphone to non-digital means. In 2019 Google announced a "paper phone" which can contain daily agendas, directions, and other uses so that people rely less on their smartphone.[20] Another key element of a moderate detox is controlling the frequency of notifications and alerts.[21] This can alleviate the temptation to check devices continuously throughout the day.

Complete detox[edit]
A complete detox is an absolute break from digital devices for a set period. This form of detox can be conducted for various periods, the most common ranging between a week and a month. During a complete detox, individuals delete or log out of all social media and messaging apps. Many disable their devices entirely.[22] Some individuals implement this form of detox during a vacation or a period when there are no work or social obligations that would require their online presence. The tourism industry has found a niche market for 'digital detox travel packages' where tourists are disconnected from their Information and communications technology by traveling to remote areas. A study from University of Nottingham Ningbo China found that the biggest motivators for embarking on a digital detox holiday include mindfulness, technostress, relaxation, and self-expression.[23] Digital detox retreats increase accountability among individuals and prevent the temptation to check devices or engage in habitual online activities.

Impact[edit]
Relationships[edit]
Digital detoxes have been found to have a positive impact on relationships from a refocus on offline social interactions. People can build stronger social bonds when they do not check their phones as frequently.[24] Despite this positive impact, studies have found negative effects of digital detoxes on social relationships and interactions. Digital detoxes have also been shown to cause a higher social pressure on participants during social media abstinence compared to pre-intervention social pressure measurements. Furthermore, some research indicates that digital detoxes can result in the fear of missing out (FOMO) on social activities.[25]

Health[edit]

Smartphone usage can disturb sleep and cause vision problems.
Digital detoxes have been found to have positive effects on physical health, such as reducing eye strain, dry eyes, and blurry vision. Additionally, a digital detox can address neck pain caused by being in a hunched position from looking at a phone.[26] Furthermore, detoxing has been shown to improve time perception in participants.[27]

Digital detoxes have also been found to have a positive impact on mental health. Studies have found that digital detoxes can reduce stress and anxiety caused by the overuse of technology, along with reducing depressive symptoms.[28] Researchers have also found that detoxes can improve feelings of well-being. Overall happiness and life satisfaction were also found to increase with reduced daily social media use.[29]

The choice of a good data structure makes it possible to perform a variety of critical operations effectively. An efficient data structure also uses minimum memory space and execution time to process the structure. A data structure is not only used for organising the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge of data structures.

Need Of Data Structure:
The structure of the data and the synthesis of the algorithm are relative to each other. Data presentation must be easy to understand so the developer, as well as the user, can make an efficient implementation of the operation.
Data structures provide an easy way of organising, retrieving, managing, and storing data.

Here is a list of the needs for data.

Data structure modification is easy. 
It requires less time. 
Save storage memory space. 
Data representation is easy. 
Easy access to the large database
Classification/Types of Data Structures:
    Linear Data Structure
    Non-Linear Data Structure.
  Linear Data Structure:
Elements are arranged in one dimension ,also known as linear dimension.
Example: lists, stack, queue, etc.
 Non-Linear Data Structure
Elements are arranged in one-many, many-one and many-many dimensions.
Example: tree, graph, table, etc.
Classification of Data Structure

Please refer DSA Tutorial for complete tutorial on Data Strictures with guide on every topic, practice problems and top interview questions.

Most Popular Data Structures: 
1. Array:
An array is a collection of data items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array). 


Array Data Structure
2. Linked Lists:
Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers. 


Linked Data Structure


3. Stack:
Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). In stack, all insertion and deletion are permitted at only one end of the list.

Stack Operations:

push(): When this operation is performed, an element is inserted into the stack.
pop(): When this operation is performed, an element is removed from the top of the stack and is returned.
top(): This operation will return the last inserted element that is at the top without removing it.
size(): This operation will return the size of the stack i.e. the total number of elements present in the stack.
isEmpty(): This operation indicates whether the stack is empty or not.
4. Queue:
Like Stack, Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). In the queue, items are inserted at one end and deleted from the other end. A good example of the queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added. 


Queue Data Structure
Queue Operations:

Enqueue(): Adds (or stores) an element to the end of the queue..
Dequeue(): Removal of elements from the queue.
The choice of a good data structure makes it possible to perform a variety of critical operations effectively. An efficient data structure also uses minimum memory space and execution time to process the structure. A data structure is not only used for organising the data.

Queue Data Structure
Queue Operations:

Enqueue(): Adds (or stores) an element to the end of the queue..
Dequeue(): Removal of elements from the queue.
Peek() or front(): Acquires the data element available at the front node of the queue without deleting it.
rear(): This operation returns the element at the rear end without removing it.
isFull(): Validates if the queue is full.
isNull(): Checks if the queue is empty.
5. Binary Tree:
Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack and queues, which are linear data structures, trees are hierarchical data structures. A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. It is implemented mainly using Links. 

A Binary Tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node in the tree. If the tree is empty, then the value of root is NULL. A Binary Tree node contains the following parts. 

1. Data
2. Pointer to left child
3. Pointer to the right child

Binary Tree Data Structure
6. Binary Search Tree:
A Binary Search Tree is a Binary Tree following the additional properties: 

The left part of the root node contains keys less than the root node key.
The right part of the root node contains keys greater than the root node key.
There is no duplicate key present in the binary tree.
A Binary tree having the following properties is known as Binary search tree (BST).


Binary Search Tree Data Structure
7. Heap:
A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types: 

Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of its children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of its children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

Max and Min Heap
8. Hash Table Data Structure:
Hashing is an important Data Structure which is designed to use a special function called the Hash function which is used to map a given value with a particular key for faster access of elements. The efficiency of mapping depends on the efficiency of the hash function used. 

Let a hash function H(x) maps the value x at the index x%10 in an Array. For example, if the list of values is [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] it will be stored at positions {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} in the array or Hash table respectively. 


Hash Data Structure
9. Matrix:
A matrix represents a collection of numbers arranged in an order of rows and columns. It is necessary to enclose the elements of a matrix in parentheses or brackets. 

A matrix with 9 elements is shown below. 


Matrix
10. Trie:
Trie is an efficient information retrieval data structure. Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to an optimal limit (key length). If we store keys in the binary search tree, a well-balanced BST will need time proportional to M * log N, where M is maximum string length and N is the number of keys in the tree. Using Trie, we can search the key in O(M) time. However, the penalty is on Trie storage requirements. 


Trie Data Structure
11. Graph:
Graph is a data structure that consists of a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Graphs are used to represent relationships between objects and are widely used in computer science, mathematics, and other fields. Graphs can be used to model a wide variety of real-world systems, such as social networks, transportation networks, and computer networks.

Design and Implement Special Stack Data Structure
Last Updated : 26 Apr, 2025
Design a Data Structure SpecialStack that supports all the stack operations like push(), pop(), isEmpty(), isFull() and an additional operation getMin() which should return minimum element from the SpecialStack. All these operations of SpecialStack must be O(1). To implement SpecialStack, you should only use standard Stack data structure and no other data structure like arrays, list, . etc. 

Note: The output of the code will be the value returned by getMin() function.

Examples: 

Input: [18, 19, 29, 15, 16]
Output: 15
Explanation: The minimum element of the stack is 15.

Input: stack: [34, 335, 1814, 86]
Output: 34
Explanation: The minimum element of the stack is 34.
